# Identifying-members-of-The-Royal-Family
I took up the image of England's Royal family and I built a model that would detect Meghan Markle's face from the image and blur the faces of all other members of the royal family except her. For this I firstly used the haar-cascade frontal face detector algorithm to detect the number of faces in an image. Then I collected several images of Meghan Markle and other members of Royal family and labelled them out. After I trained opencv's LBPHfacerecognizer model with training dataset. After training I gave the test image of the royal family from which the model detected the face of Meghan Markle and leaving her face I blurred the faces of all other members of the royal family.
